            <p> Hello, my name is Marco Sandoval. I am currently working and attending online classes full time. It's definitely been a challenge so far, but I know if I continue to endure that I will obtain my Bachelor's degree in Software Development.</p>

            <p>Arizona is a state located in the south western borders of the United States of America. We really only have two seasons out here: hellfire, or freezing (about two months out of the year). Our state capitol is Phoenix which is the largest city in the state, housing about 1.644 million people according to the Cebsus Bureau 2023. Arizona is also known as the "Copper State" due to the large amounts of it found in the state.</p>
