            <p> Hello, my name is Marco Sandoval. I am currently working and attending online classes full time. It's definitely been a challenge so far, but I know if I continue to endure that I will obtain my Bachelor's degree in Software Development. I am a father to my six year old boy from another marriage. My wife an I are also expecting our first baby together as we are 13 weeks pregnant. I love to draw realism using charcoal and graphite. I am a convert to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and was baptized in June of 2023. Coding is something I have no experience with, but I am trying to make a career out of this. I am the only member of my family to have received the Gospel, and although I have been striving to be the living example of Chrsits' love in their lives, I have had no success in converting anybody. By obtaining my degree, I hope to be able to show them how much more fullfilling life can be when you're on Heavenly Fathers side.</p>

            <p>Arizona is a state located in the south western borders of the United States of America. We really only have two seasons out here: hellfire, or freezing (about two months out of the year). Our state capitol is Phoenix which is the largest city in the state, housing about 1.644 million people according to the Cebsus Bureau 2023. Arizona is also known as the "Copper State" due to the large amounts of it found in the state.</p>
